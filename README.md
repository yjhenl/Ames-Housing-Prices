# Ames Housing Prices

## Introduction

I pick this dataset for practice because I am curious about the factors influencing house price. With 79 variables describing many aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this dataset can help me have a deeper understanding on how the house price is determined. In the future, if I want to buy a house, I would have a sense on the possibilities for price negotiation.

## Key Questions

I would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

```
● Which factors contribute the most to housing prices?

● How has the housing prices changed over the years?

● Which locations within Ames city limits have higher/lower housing price? 

● How many new houses are built each year?

 ```
 
## Data

The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values.
